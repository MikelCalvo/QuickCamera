QuickCamera is a library built with Kotlin on top of the library [CameraView](https://github.com/natario1/CameraView) to offer a quick way to launch a camera with a light theme inside your app

## How to implement it
First, check if you have jitpack added to your build.gradle
It has to be something like this:

````

allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
  
````  

Then you will have to add the library to your dependencies like this:

````
implementation 'net.MikelCalvo:QuickCamera:v1.0.0'
````
